# User Guide

## Running the App
- Create and activate a virtual environment (see README for details).
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Start the app: `streamlit run app.py`.
- Do not run with `python app.py`; the UI won't start that way.

## Adding a New Entry
- Launch the app â€” today's date will already be in a blank row.
- Fill out:
  - Topic
  - Time Spent (minutes)
  - What you practiced
  - Challenges
  - Wins
  - Confidence (1-5)
  - Tags (comma-separated, optional)
- Progress Score will be calculated automatically.

### Validation
- Topic is required and limited to 200 characters.
- Minutes must be between 0 and 1440.
- Confidence must be between 1 and 5.
- Tags are comma-separated; up to 10 tags, each up to 32 characters.

## Viewing History

### Edit/Delete
- Use the "Select date to edit" dropdown to pick a past entry by its date.

## Data Management
- Export your data as CSV.
- Automatic daily backups are stored locally.
 - Automatic CSV sync: the app reads from and writes to a CSV in your Documents folder (`Documents/Learning Progress Tracker/entries.csv`).

### Importing Data
- Go to the **Data** page.
- Click "Import CSV" and select your file.
- Required column: `date`. Optional: `topic, minutes, practiced, challenges, wins, confidence, tags`.
- The app validates in the background and imports automatically if valid.
- If there are issues (e.g., missing dates or invalid values), an error panel shows details and nothing is saved.

## Settings
- Set a weekly goal (in minutes) under the **Settings** page. The Insights page shows current week progress.

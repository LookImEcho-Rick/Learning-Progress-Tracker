## Insights
- **Bar chart:** Minutes studied per day.

- **Line chart:** Progress score over time.
- **Weekly table:** Weekly totals and averages.

## Data Management
- Export your data as JSON.
- Automatic daily backups are stored locally.
- Automatic JSON sync: the app reads from and writes to a JSON file in your Documents folder (`Documents/Learning Progress Tracker/entries.json`).
- Override sync path with env var `LPT_JSON_PATH` to point to a custom file.

### Importing Data
- Go to the **Data** page.
- Click "Import JSON" and select your file.
- JSON format: a list of entries where each entry is an object with `date` and optional `topic, minutes, practiced, challenges, wins, confidence, tags`.
- The app validates in the background and imports automatically if valid.
- If there are issues (e.g., missing dates or invalid values), an error panel shows details and nothing is saved.

## Settings
- Set a weekly goal (in minutes) under the **Settings** page. The Insights page shows current week progress.
